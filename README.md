# Simon-game
The Simon Game is an engaging memory-based game where players must replicate a randomly generated sequence of colors and sounds. The sequence becomes progressively longer with each level, challenging the player's memory and focus. Here's a detailed description of the game:
#### **Features:**
1. **Interactive Gameplay:**
   - The game uses four colored buttons: **Red**, **Green**, **Blue**, and **Yellow**. Each button corresponds to a unique sound and animation.
   
2. **Dynamic Sequences:**
   - At the start of each level, the game randomly adds a new color to the sequence. The player must replicate the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.

3. **Level Progression:**
   - The game starts at Level 1 and progresses as the player completes each sequence. With each level, the sequence becomes longer, increasing the difficulty.

4. **Feedback System:**
   - Correct inputs are acknowledged with sound and animation, while incorrect inputs result in a "game over" state with an error sound and a flashing screen.

5. **Restart Option:**
   - If the player makes a mistake, the game resets and allows them to restart from Level 1.

#### **How to Play:**
1. **Start the Game:**
   - Press any key to begin. The game will display and play a sequence of colors and sounds.
2. **Repeat the Sequence:**
   - Click the buttons in the exact order shown by the game.
3. **Progress Through Levels:**
   - Successfully replicate the sequence to move to the next level. Each level adds a new color to the sequence.
4. **Game Over:**
   - If you make a mistake, the game ends. You can restart by pressing any key.

#### **Technologies Used:**
- **HTML** for the structure of the game.
- **CSS** for styling the game interface and animations.
- **JavaScript** and **jQuery** for game logic, event handling, and dynamic updates.

#### **Highlights:**
- A fun and challenging way to test and improve your memory.
- Eye-catching animations and sounds enhance the gaming experience.
